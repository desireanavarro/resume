<pre><code>    1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
</code></pre>

<p>I’m most interested in programming because it is something that has popped up on my radar throughout the years. My first exposure came when I was just ( ) myspace had just became popular in my neck of the woods and they allowed you to edit your page, the second time being at about 18 when a co-worker turned friend of mine who is now an engineer suggested it to me when we worked together. The third time being at age 25 when a co-worker actually mentioned Ada Academy to me however the application process was closed and I talked myself out of it. As a working mother and now stay at home mom we often convince ourself we’ll continue to go on living our lives after the kids are all grown on. I however received a nudge and suggestion from my seven year old himself thatI go back to school since he was having so much fun in school I should try it again too! So I took myself online to Khan Academy and did some of the basic lessons for JavaScript and really got the hang of it, it really inspired me to give it a go.</p>

<pre><code>    2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?
</code></pre>

<p>In the next 2 years I see myself learning to master a new position within a brand new company in an innovative field such as technology with the help of the Ada Academy program. In the next 5 years I see myself being a leader and role model within the technology community and using my education to give back to the community and fellow student of interest. It’s important to me that I constantly be improving in any work that I choose to do and the field of technology is the perfect opportunity to do just that.</p>

<pre><code>    3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
</code></pre>

<p>Self reflection is a very important part of how I function, if you don’t reflect you run the risk of repeating mistakes. The biggest mistake I think I learned from the most and had the biggest impact on my life was fighting for a job that I wasn’t suited for. I had spent some time meeting with my team lead and office manager to resolve the conflict, certain things were asked of me and with time I would soon forget and get back in to my routine of things. I was frustrated that I for once was not succeeding at something so I finally sat down and racked my brain as to what the possible problem could be, what I could change and so on. It’s was no easy to task to sit down and learn that the problem was me and the way that I liked to work. I returned to work defeated and admitting to both my team lead and office manager that I may not the best person for this particular position, they like me were very sad to see me leave that position however found something within the company that worked out beautifully for everyone.</p>

<pre><code>    4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.
</code></pre>

<p>At the tender age of 11 in the age of Myspace and all things social media I actually taught myself how to what I am learning today is called writing in Markdown and basic HTML. I had no idea what I was doing as far as labeling goes but I ‘Right Click Source’ my way in to a more colorful Myspace page. Along with that came the ability to also load images which was a segue in to the world of Photoshop and Photography as current hobbies of mine. I would copy the text to a basic text document and pick through the code. I learned to change things but tweaking numbers and colors and then seeing what effect it would have on my page. It was a very long and drawn out process but in Jr. High I had the time.</p>
